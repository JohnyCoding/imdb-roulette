## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies with legacy peer deps

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Second, take a look at the .exampleenv file, and create a .env file in the root of the project with the same structure

```bash
BEARER="YOUR BEARER TOKEN HERE"
API_KEY="YOUR API KEY HERE"
```

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## About the project

This is a fun app I made to force my friends to watch random movies. You too can force your friends to watch movies they don't want to, and chalk it up to their bad luck. Enjoy!
